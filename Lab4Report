    Part 1:
\end{center}
 The objective of part one is to use the code previously made to write a transfer function. This is completed by creating the three functions.
 $h1(t) = exp(-2t)[u(t)-u(t - 3)]$
 $h2(t) = u(t - 2) - u(t - 6)$
 $h3(t) = cos(w * t)u(t)$
 Then plotting the three functions. These plots can be seen in Figure one.



\begin{center}
    Part 2:
\end{center}
The objective of part 2 was to calculate and plot the step response of the three transfer functions in part one. The first task was to plot the step response of the functions using the convolution function created in the previous lab. These plots can be seen in Figure two, three, and four respectively. The next step was to calculate the step response and plot them. The calculated step responses are as follows. $S1(t) = 0.5[1 - exp(-2t)]u(t) - 0.5[1 - exp(-2(t - 3))]u(t - 3)$
$S2(t) = (t - 2)u(t - 2) - (t - 6)u(t - 6)$
$S3(t) = 1/(pi/2)*sin((pi/2)*t)u(t)$
The plot for the hand calculations can be seen in figure five.

    Conclusion
\end{center}
This lab helped me gain a better understanding on how to find step functions using a convolutions. Also how to use python to find step functions using convolutions.
