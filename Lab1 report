\maketitle
\begin{center}
    Part 1:
\end{center}
 The objective of part one was to make a simple user defined function. This was accomplished by importing numpy and matplotlib.plot.the numpy package allows for functions like cosine and sine to be used. A Cosine graph was then made for the Task 2.



\begin{center}
    Part 2:
\end{center}
The objective of part 2 was to make a function to match the plot seen in Figure one. This was done by first writing coming up with the function seen in Math one. The next step was to graph a step and ramp function in python. The Final step was to graph the function seen in Math one in python. 


\begin{center}
    Part 3:
\end{center}
The objective of part 3 was to manipulate the function from part two using time shifing and scaling operations. This was done by ploting the derivative plot seen in Figure 2. The next part was to add a time reversal to the function in math one and plot it. This can be seen in the Github Lab2Part3-6.3.0 code. After this was done time shift operations of f(t - 4) and f(-t - 4) were applied to our function. This code can also be seen in Lab2Part3-6.3.0 code. Next a time scale operation of f(t / 2) and f(2t) were applied to the function and then plotted. This can be seen in Lab2Part3-6.3.1 in Github. the final step was to then plot the deriviative of our function using the numpy.diff() function. This can be seen in the Lab2Part3-6.3.1 code in Github.

\begin{center}
    Questions:
\end{center}
1. Are the plots from Part 3 Task 4 and Part 3 Task 5 identical? Is it possible for them to match? Explain why or why not. 

The plots are similar, but not identical. I believe this is because I may have implemented numpy.diff() incorrectly in my code. They look the same, but python is graphing the 1 and -1 slope as spikes rather than constant slopes. 


2.How does the correlation between the two plots (from Part 3 Task 4 and Part 3 Task 5) change if you were to change the step size within the time varaible in Task 5? Explain why this happens.

The correlation between the two plots actually gets better when the step size is decreased. I believe this happens, because the spikes that python was plotting in the numpy.diff() function had worse resolution; making those spikes less spiky and more flat. 

3. Leave any feedback on the clarity of lab tasks, expectations, and deliverable. 

Lab seemed pretty straight forward in what it wanted.

Math 1:
$r(t) - r(t - 3) + 5 * u(t - 3) - 2 * u(t - 6) - 2 * r(t - 6)$
