\maketitle
\begin{center}
    Part 1:
\end{center}
 The objective of part one was to use the ramp and step functions from the previous lab to create functions that could be used in the rest of the lab. This was accomplished defining the three functions seen in Formula one, two, and three. The next part of this was to plot the functions with a range of [0,20]. This can be seen in Figure one. 



\begin{center}
    Part 2:
\end{center}
The objective of part 2 was to code a function that could convole two other functions. This was done by creating a function that used arrays to convolve two functions. The code for task one can be seen in the part 2 task 1 section on Github. The next step for this part was to plot the convolution of f1 and f2. This can be seen in Figure two. After this was done the convolution of f2 and f3 was taken. This can be seen in Figure three. Finally the convolution of f1 and f3 were taken. This can be seen in figure four.


\begin{center}
    Questions:
\end{center}
1. Did you work alone or with a classmate on this lab? If you collaborated to get the solution what did that process look like?

I worked alone on this lab, however I did ask one of my friends that is more proficent at coding than myself to help explain array's to me better. He was able to explain two key points about them that helped me greatly. The first being that array is defined in the format as (name, information). The information part of this can be an integer that preforms basic arithmetic to help get array's to be the same length. The other key point was that arrays can have mathematical operations done directly to them.


2. What was the most difficult part of this lab for you, and what did your problem-solving process look like?

The most difficult part of this lab was how to wrap my head around how to use the array's in my Conv function to complete task one. The problem solving process I went with was to have my friend explain some basic programming fundamentals to me. This was addressed in question one.

3. Did you approach writing the code with analytical or graphical convolution in mind? why did you chose this approach? 

I went through this with an analytical approach. This was because I was not too confident with convolutions until our TA helped explain them with an analytical expression using lighting matches as an example. 

4. Leave any feedback on the clarity of lab tasks, expectations, and deliverables.

The lab was straight foward and I have no feedback to leave.

    Math
\end{center}

Formula One:
$f1(t) = u(t - 2) - u(t - 9)$

Formula Two:
$f2(t) = exp(-t)u(t)$

Formula Three:
$f3(t) = r(t - 2)[u(t - 2) - u(t - 3)] + r(4 - t)[u(t - 3) - u(t - 4)]$

\begin{center}
    Conclusion
\end{center}
This lab helped me gain a better understand on what a convolution is and in some basic fundamentals of programming. The example that was given by our TA for matches being lit and how to represent it with a convolution help me understand them better. To further this understanding coding a function to do the convolutions help me seen graphically how to convolutions come out. Also I gained a better understanding of array's and how they are used in mathematical expressions in python.
